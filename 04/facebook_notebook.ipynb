In detail, the facebook circles (friends lists) of ten people will be examined and scrutinized in order to extract all kinds of valuable information. The dataset can be found at this link: [Stanford Facebook Dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html). Moreover, as known, a facebook network is undirected and has no weights because one user can become friends with another user just once. Looking at the dataset from a graph analysis perspective:\n* Each node represents an anonymized facebook user that belongs to one of those ten friends lists.\n* Each edge corresponds to the friendship of two facebook users that belong to this network. In other words, two users must become friends on facebook in order for them to be connected in the particular network.\n\nNote: Nodes $0, 107, 348, 414, 686, 698, 1684, 1912, 3437, 3980$ are the ones whose friends list will be examined.

In detail, the triadic closure means that as time goes on, new edges tend to form between two users that have one or more mutual friends. That can be explained by the fact that Facebook usually suggests new friends to a user when there are many mutual friends between the user and the new friend to be added. Also, there is a source of latent stress. For example, if node $A$ is friends with\nnode $B$ and $C$,  some tension builds up if $B$ and $C$ are not friends with each other.","block_group":"36a8fdd5bb774666a1b8aa0c4ae77658"},{"cellId":"45a107f043a94da1a4d77c6d95831ac3","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"45a107f043a94da1a4d77c6d95831ac3","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Bridges\nFirst of all, an edge joining two nodes A and B in the graph is considered a bridge, if deleting the edge would cause A and B to lie in two different components.
